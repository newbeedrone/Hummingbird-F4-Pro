The second generation of the HummingBird F4 products. Compare to 1st Generation, we changed the Gyro to Bosch BMI160 which is smaller and more reliable compared to the MPU6000. (It can't use the same firmware target as the 1st Generation HummingBird F4 1S.) We also changed the camera plug to have a JST 4 pin (OSD Signal, BeeSign signal, 5V, GND) so now you can either use BeeSign Control or BeeSign OSD (more explanation of the BeeSign is down below.). Last but not least, we also optimised the layout and increase the high current layout trace to handle more power.
